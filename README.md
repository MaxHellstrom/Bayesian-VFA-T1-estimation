# Bayesian-VFA-T1-estimation

## Welcome!

This repository contains code for running a MATLAB implementation of tissue parameter estimation of T1 (from VFA data) with different spatial priors, as described in 
_"Bayesian non-linear regression with spatial priors for noise reduction and error estimation in quantitative MRI with an application in T1 estimation."_ (DOI: 10.1088/1361-6560/abb9f5 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/abb9f5)) 

A synthetic dataset is provided in the data folder. Please run the different cells in main.m. NOTE: Hyperparameter search is already conducted for the synthetic dataset. The selected kappa-value is provided in the synthetic dataset.
